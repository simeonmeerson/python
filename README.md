Basic Python script to:

1) Count rows in a folder of CSV files & output the row counts (by each file) into a new csv file
2) Overwrite (certain) column name values
3) Drop column by a given column name
4) Populate Preprocessed CSV files into a separate folder (leaving raw downloads untouched)
5) Consolidate all pre processed csv files into one csv file
